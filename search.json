    "text": "I am a grad student at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am honored to be apart of the diverse and dedicated student body of such a pivotal institution. With some of Texas’s foremost instructors, I am continuously learning the skills needed to tackle the challenges facing dynamic organizations across the globe. I hope to use these assets to assist businesses and governments wherever they are with the ever changing needs of growth and development.\n\nI also have nearly a decade of experience working in the customer service industry. A rewarding career that has taught me the invaluableness of teamwork, and what can be accomplished when people work together. I have performed roles utilizing skills as varied as logistical coordination, management, and shipping accommodation. I am also a firm believer in the utility brought about by an inclusive workforce. The meshing of differing approaches to any task at hand is any institution’s ultimate resource.\n\nI am excited to continue expanding my knowledge base and skill set in order to achieve my professional goals. I look forward to the journey I will share with my fellow classmates in the near future and my co-workers in the longer one."
